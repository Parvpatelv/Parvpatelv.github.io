                <p>Hi there! My name is Parv Patel, and I'm a passionate web developer that loves building responsive and user-friendly websites. My journey started a few years ago when I fell in love with design and coding. I've since committed myself to studying and becoming an expert in web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and several frameworks.</p>
                <p>I want to learn more about web development trends, improve my skills, and work with classmates on fascinating projects in this program. I think that the secret to success in this sector is constant learning combined with real-world application.</p>
                <p>Stay tuned for more updates and links to my projects!</p>
